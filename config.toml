### Course Outline:

- Information Gathering
- Vulnerability Identification
- Exploitation
- Password Cracking
- Privilege Escalation
- Capture the Flag

### Course Description

Practice and real-world application are critical to learning how to effectively conduct penetration tests. Coalfire's 1-day Introduction to Penetration Testing class an immersive course that will provide practical experience and a solid framework for conducting in-depth penetration tests in enterprise environments. The majority of this course is spent in a fully operational lab environment, overcoming the real-world obstacles faced in today's enterprise networks. We will cover tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) successful penetration testers use to provide comprehensive and efficient security assessments in a variety of enterprise environments. Methods presented are based on TTPs continually being refined by our penetration testers' operational experience.

Utilizing the right tool for the job is often the difference-maker for an effective penetration test. We will walk you through various commercial and open-source tools for identifying attack vectors and infiltrating enterprise environments. We will cover both network and web testing tools and frameworks. These tools will enable you to collaboratively conduct penetration tests efficiently and effectively against variable target environments. You will also overcome obstacles, practice modern attack techniques, and learn how to use advanced tactics to force-multiply your penetration tests. This course is a smaller version of our BlackHat course and has been updated with current operational methodologies, techniques, and toolsets.

### Who Should Take This Course

Participants with 2+ years of Windows (command-line), Linux, and/or network administration experience, who are interested in learning core penetration testing tradecraft.

### Who Would Not be a Good Fit for This Class?

This class is mostly hands-on and requires prior experience with Windows, Linux, and networks administration. Students who do not have Windows or Linux command-line proficiency or students who are not ready for a fast-paced class will not be a good fit.

### Student Requirements

To get the most from this course, participants should have the following experience:

- At least 2+ years with Windows (command-line), Linux, and/or network administration
- Networking and TCP/IP fundamentals
- Experience with at least two of basic Batch, PowerShell, Bash, or Python
- Strong understanding of how HTTP works
- Experience with web development technologies
- Basic understanding of OWASP Top 10
- Experience with VirtualBox/VMWare-Workstation/Fusion. VMWare Workstation Player is not supported.
- Willingness to learn hands-on in a fast-paced environment

### What Should Students Bring

Students will be provided with a custom version of the latest Kali Linux image to perform exercises. They will need their own laptop (with administrative access), with a wireless network adapter, 8GB of RAM, and the ability to run a virtual machine (VMWare Player, VMWare Workstation, and VirtualBox). VMWare Workstation Player is not supported. Students will bring an insatiable appetite for learning.
