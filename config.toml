Each BSides is a **community-driven** framework for building events for and by information security community members.  The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.

We are excited to announce that BSides Atlanta 2022 is scheduled for Saturday, August 27th at the KSU Center in Kennesaw, Georgia!

After the events of the last two years, we thought a theme of "Re-Engage.  Re-Imagine.  Re-Ignite." seemed appropriate!

We will open the CFP website on June 3rd, with a deadline of June 24th.  We will welcome talks of either 20 or 50 minutes.

We are really excited about getting back together with everyone, and we cannot wait to see you all in August!

**We have NO TOLERANCE for physical/verbal/sexual harassment of any human,
humanoid or AI!**

Our "Code of Conduct" is **"Be Excellent to Each Other"** AKA the Golden Rule.
Failing that, it is "Do not be an Ass* or we will kick your ass out!".

Asking questions of a speaker during their talk, to get clarity or debate a
point is NOT being an ass â€“ heckling or haranguing the speaker IS. If you are
not sure, ask, or err on the side of basic decency and common courtesy. If what
they are doing would not be acceptable to have done to you, your best friend,
your worst enemy, your sister, niece, daughter, brother, nephew, son, mother,
father, or any human being, do not let them treat anyone else that way â€“ whether
 you know them or not. **If someone asks you to stop â€“ stop.**

**If you are having an issue with a BSidesATL participant of ANY type, find an
organizer.** They will assist you in determining the next steps for you to feel
safe and heard.

_*Staff reserves the right to determine what constitutes "Being an Ass"._
