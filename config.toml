Each BSides is a **community-driven** framework for building events for and by information security community members.  The goal is to expand the spectrum of conversation beyond the traditional confines of space and time.  It creates opportunities for individuals to both present and participate in an intimate atmosphere that encourages collaboration. It is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from participants. It is where conversations for the next-big-thing are happening.

We are excited to announce that BSides Atlanta 2022 is scheduled for Saturday, August 20th at the KSU Center in Kennesaw, Georgia!

After the events of the last two years, we thought a theme of "Re-Engage.  Re-Imagine.  Re-Ignite." seemed appropriate!

We will open the CFP website on June 3rd, with a deadline of June 24th.  We will welcome talks of either 20 or 50 minutes.

We are really excited about getting back together with everyone, and we cannot wait to see you all in August!
