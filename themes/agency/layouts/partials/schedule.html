          What do security teams need to know about software-defined infrastructure, and new capabilities we may gain from using them ourselves? What will be some of the critical skill sets for security professionals now and in the future as these technologies become ever-more pervasive? In this presentation, Dave will cover everything from virtualization to containers, software-defined networking to public cloud, with a breakdown of key areas to focus on for security teams and specific advice for different security roles and positions.

          The IR consultants always say the same thing about incident response "Have a Plan, Follow the Plan". In the military they say "The battle plan goes out the window when the bullets start flying". The fact of the matter is that incident response in the real world is more like the latter than the former. Everyone knows how to work an incident when everything is wrapped up in a tight little bow, the tools are deployed, the data is accessible, and everyone is in agreement on exactly what to do and how. This talk isn't about those incidents. This talk is about the incident that happens when you are a one man shop with no tools and no resources and you need to work things out in a hurry. In short, this talk attempts to deal with the human aspects of incident response, and how to be an incident responder, not how to do incident response. I discuss the human aspects of response, and how to cope with the stresses and complexities of incident response in a modern environment where nothing goes according to plan.

          Voice assistants are popping up everywhere. Many wonder and worry whether we are voluntarily wire tapping ourselves. Your Alexa or Google Assistant doesn't have to be a magical box that represents a possible security vulnerability in your home (or car). Come join me as we explore how voice assistants work. I'm a firm believer that you need to know how something works before you can truly secure it. Next, we'll explore the threat vectors that all voice assistants share. And finally, and how they can be protected.

          This presentation is based on 20+ years in cybersecurity working across 50+ countries.  It will explore the real-life history and use cases of hackers, hooligans, and heists. From mechanical computers to the Internet, acts of sabotage, fraud, theft, and other nefarious undertakings have been conducted with low risk, minimal hurdles, and high reward. In some cases, attackers even receive safe harbor from prosecution. Bad actors ranging from insiders and hacktivists to cybercriminals and nation-states are motivated by money, politics, revenge, and ideology. We will translate the “who, how, and why” of cyberattacks. We will identify multiple “old school” and modern-day threat vectors and organize attacks by motives like sabotage and espionage. Each threat actor type will be explored in detail with real-life use cases and personal accountants. The examples used will illustrate the diversity in threats, methods, motivations, and organizational responses.

          Small businesses are often overlooked when it comes to mature Security Operations. In fact, some MSSPs and security vendors won’t sell to businesses with less than 150 employees. This is a huge gap, especially when you consider supply chain attacks, and breaches like Target. When you consider their place in the security ecosystem, these businesses are “too small to fail”.

          It seems there is a never-ending stream of acronyms that businesses now must learn and understand in order to be “compliant.” In fact, you may feel like a cat herder that is chasing one audit after another. Each new entrant into the pantheon of compliance complicates and weaves and even more complex web of checklists, procedures, policies, etc. Each time new letters are added to our alphabet soup of regulations we must scramble to meet those specific lists of requirements.
        What if there were a better way? In this presentation, we’ll take a step back and consider that all frameworks and requirements are very similar. In fact, about 80% of PCI and HIPAA controls overlap. Let’s look at the different framework audit requirements and see how we can take a common-sense approach to your next audit.
        At the end of the day regulations have many of the same themes. Check audit logs, protect desktops, train users, etc. The first step is to start with a baseline, a starting point upon which all other compliances can be compared. After the baseline has been established, you’ll be able to quite the noise and provide a clear path towards meeting existing and yet to come compliance matrices.

          Continuous monitoring sounds intimidating, needing fancy and expensive sensors and software (hardware network taps? SIEM? SOAR?) to make it work. Cost sometimes puts these tools out of the realm of the possible for cybersecurity analysts and analysts in-training wanting to secure home and small business setups. If willing to invest time instead of money, we can use free and inexpensive tools to achieve the same end. I’ll provide an overview of a continuous monitoring system built on open-source tools (e.g. Docker, OpenVPN, Apache NiFi) and cheap hardware sensors (OpenWRT routers!) to collect data. I’ll then focus on how I use Google’s cloud storage, cloud processing, and a custom tradecraft documentation tool (similar to Jupyter Notebook) for capturing the Python and PowerShell scripts used for analysis. I’ll share what worked and what didn’t work in developing and operating this system. Specifically, I’ll highlight what data I’m collecting from my sensors and systems, how I collect it (using OpenWRT, Python, and Powershell), where I’m storing it, and how I analyze it. I’ll demonstrate how to fit these pieces together for implementing and monitoring some of the CIS Top 20 Controls.

          This presentation outlines a new twist on an existing social engineering attack. In the past, we have worked on getting users to plug in USB devices to drop malicious documents and executables. While this attack sometimes proves our point, it is the tip of the iceberg that can be done. Enter Social Forensication. This is a two-pronged attack, consisting first of collecting a memory image for offsite offensive forensic analysis, the second being a rogue Wi-Fi access point attack. During this presentation, we will walk through the steps to perform each attack. Since defense is just as (if not more) important as the attack itself, we will also discuss mitigations (technical and procedural) and relevant windows detections for these attacks.

          "Connected Medical Devices (CMDs) help sustain lives, monitor vital signs, improve medical adherence, and offer non-invasive methods of remote monitoring and auto-diagnosing. To provide these directed functionalities, CMDs collect, store, and share vast amounts of patient PII and PHI (medical data). Amid the benefits CMDs provide, privacy however, has become a matter of dispute. It has raised several ethical questions on data security, data ownership, consent, and data usage as more and more insecure products are released into the market and as conglomerates take a capitalistic approach to data usage (CMD providers are known to sell data to insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies without the knowledge or consent of the CMD consumer). This presentation primarily looks at the current state (the types of data collected, software and hardware issues that compromise privacy), reviews the impacts of privacy loss, and evaluates the challenges in implementing privacy controls from both the technical and non-technical standpoints while making a reference to case studies. It also illustrates technical techniques for preserving and enhancing privacy in medical devices. The presentation will also propose policy improvements based on a gap analysis of existing standards laid out by NIST/FDA,etc, and propose principles for privacy engineering."

          "Agility isn’t a concept reserved for development teams pushing code into production every couple of hours. We as security professionals need to be agile too, something we have traditionally not done well. Our challenge is the fact that not only do we need to support the development team's goals, but everyone else’s goals as well. Even if change weren’t inevitable, our jobs would still be an uphill battle. Sprinkle in some evolving threats and a dash of new technologies, and we have a recipe for what seems like a lost cause. Talent shortages, budgetary restrictions, and opposing goals create an environment that pits us against other business units, and a continued perspective based on worst case scenarios aren’t doing us any favors. Whether you're a CISO or a penetration tester, we need a significant upgrade to our approach if we hope to enjoy success addressing the challenges velocity and scale bring our way. This presentation is about shifting our perceptions and embracing opportunities in unexpected places. We can’t be successful in a vacuum and with the right mixture of agility and collaboration, security teams can adapt along with the pace of business. Let’s stop being the group of “no” and start being the group of “how” setting ourselves up for the best opportunity for success. Join the conversation and be part of securing the future."

Are you trying to get started in a cybersecurity career or do you have one and are looking to advance? Come learn what you need to have (and what you don't need but may help) and how to apply your strengths and experience to hunting for jobs in security. Getting an infosec job is a lot like testing security systems or defending against an attack: Preparation and planning are what make the difference. I'll share tips and resources to help you build your own job hunting process so you can plan and execute effectively. We'll discuss "dos and don'ts" for job hunting, social networking, resumes, and I'll tell you how to prepare for and succeed in "the infosec interview". Over the last ten years I've been in hundreds of interviews for IT and security positions, primarily at large companies. I genuinely want it to be a better experience for everyone. We badly need more good people in the business and community of infosec.

          New privacy laws have advanced individual data rights, although the ability to request access to all personal information held by a company has created new attack vectors for OSINT, phishing, social engineering, and “legal DDoS.” This talk covers regional data access options, how most companies respond to requests, and exploits for common privacy vulnerabilities. We’ll explore the psychology driving corporate responses to requests, ways to exploit these emotions, and the weakest targets for attacks. For the blue teamers, detection and defense strategies will be presented. A cheatsheet with key sections of the laws for exploits and defense will provided.

          Social media platforms have become an integral part of our normal interactions and in some instances replacing human to human interactions altogether. There are an estimated 2.27 billion users logging onto Facebook, and 260 million logging onto LinkedIn monthly and sharing their private data. This increase in the use of social media and oversharing of information on social media has however, introduced users to a new threat: cyberstalking. Cyberstalking can range from trolling on social media to physically stalking of victims and causing them bodily harm. The Data &amp; Society Research Institute and the Center for Innovative Public Health Research published findings in 2017 of a nationally representative study suggesting that about 8% of Americans have been stalked online with the physical threats impacting women between the ages of 18-24.
           
          Cyberstalking has become a consequence of privacy breaches (via fake profiles, poor implementation of privacy controls, and lack of awareness of the privacy controls) that social media platforms have failed to or are struggling to address, and that the law enforcement agencies are unable to hold them accountable for the breaches. It was found that, of the estimated users logging into social media platforms, 83 million of Facebook profiles and 56 million of LinkedIn profiles were found to be fake, and that the unclear terms of services merely exacerbated the efforts of law enforcement as to who was responsible for the breach.
           
          Nonetheless, over the years, regulations have been created to alleviate the dangers of cyberstalking, however, issues such as ambiguity in terms of services on social media platforms, user oversharing, and lax privacy controls still play a part in the growing concern of maintaining privacy on social media. This presentation will provide an overview of what constitutes “private data”, and how the mentioned issues can be contained with meaningful efforts taken by social media platforms and the users alike. The presentation also borrows elements of GDPR and the California Privacy Bill to address privacy breaches that may lead to cyber-stalking.

          "Hey, Alexa! What should I get Billy for his birthday?". It seems absurd, but it's become reality that we ask the electronic residents in our homes these very questions. It seems the devices with which our children interact may have a better grasp on their overall interests and activities than we (parents) do. What might be the everlasting impact from this type of lifestyle, and what do these devices know about us and our family that we might have never guessed? These questions, among others will be explored in this discussion of the continued depletion of privacy within our very own homes. While usage of such technology is certainly not mandatory, what kind of impact does it place on relationships with peers and their families, to abstain from these habits of embracing technology in such pervasive ways?  How is our privacy impacted by our natural desire to conform with societal norms?  This talk will offer the audience several technologically-oriented privacy implications to consider, as well as some tools and techniques to help minimize loss of privacy when interacting with smart devices and their accompanying services.
